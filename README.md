# Global Maritime Debris Trajectory Forecasting 

This project integrates continuous-time physics modeling, advanced data analysis, and machine learning to predict the trajectory of garbage thrown into ocean at any given location and time, and offers valuable insights into global marine debris movement and enables predictive capabilities to address oceanic pollution challenges

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a virtual environment and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment while working with this project, otherwise there may be version conflicts.

#### For Linux and macOS:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Create a virtual environment named `.venv`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

#### For Windows:

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Create a virtual environment named `.venv`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

While the virtual environment is active, install project dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

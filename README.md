Global Maritime Debris Trajectory Forecasting
This project integrates continuous-time physics modeling, advanced data analysis, and machine learning to predict the trajectory of garbage thrown into ocean at any given location and time, and offers valuable insights into global marine debris movement and enables predictive capabilities to address oceanic pollution challenges

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up a virtual environment and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Setting up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment while working with this project, otherwise there may be version conflicts.

For Linux and macOS:
Open a terminal window.
Create a virtual environment named .venv:
python3 -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:
source .venv/bin/activate
For Windows:
Open Command Prompt.
Create a virtual environment named .venv:
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:
.venv\Scripts\activate
Installing Dependencies
While the virtual environment is active, install project dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
